1. OVERVIEW 

This document covers the setup where the ESP32-CAM captures images and the laptop 
itself speaks the output using server32.py. 
✔ Laptop converts text → audio and plays it directly. 
✔ No speaker amplifier or ESP32-S3 used. 
✔ ESP32‑CAM + Button + Ultrasonic alert system. 
2. ESP32‑CAM SYSTEM (freshhhcam.ino) 
• Blind person presses button. 
• ESP32‑CAM captures high‑resolution picture. 
• Encodes to Base64. 
• Sends to server32.py. 
• Server processes and plays back through laptop speakers.

After upload: - REMOVE IO0→GND - REMOVE RESET→GND - Leave TX & RX connected - 
Power CAM using Arduino’s 5V 
4. ESP32 BUZZER + ULTRASONIC SYSTEM

If obstacle < 100 cm → buzzer rings for 2 seconds. Blind user then presses camera 
button. 
5. PYTHON SERVER (server32.py – Laptop 
Audio) 
This server: 
✔ Receives Base64 image from ESP32‑CAM 
✔ Sends to OpenRouter Vision Model 
✔ Extracts readable text + objects 
✔ Cleans the text 
✔ Converts to MP3 (gTTS) 
✔ Converts MP3 → WAV using FFmpeg 
✔ Plays WAV sound DIRECTLY on laptop speakers using pygame 
HOW TO RUN 
py -3.10 server32.py 
Laptop begins speaking outputs. 
6. FULL WORKFLOW 
1. Ultrasonic sensor detects obstacle. 
2. Buzzer beeps → blind user presses button. 
3. ESP32‑CAM captures image. 
4. Image sent to laptop server (server32). 
5. Laptop: Vision analysis → OCR → Object detection. 
6. Laptop generates speech. 
7. Laptop plays audio automatically. 
7. FILES USED 
• freshhhcam.ino → ESP32-CAM 
• buzzer.ino → Ultrasonic + buzzer ESP32 
• server32.py → Laptop audio server
